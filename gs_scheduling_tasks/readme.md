# A simple practice on scheduling tasks. therefore ,as in previous section, some important annotation must be remebered:
## 1.@Scheduled
- This annotation defines when a paticular method runs.
## 2.@EnableScheduling
- This annotation must be used in main class. It ensures a background task excutor is created. If without it, nothing gets scheduled.
